# Four Word Pitch…

The game is simple: Have a conversation with a stranger to practice. Give him your business card. Then ask him to do the exercise of writing down four words to remember who you are.
If the four words are the ones you expected, you have succeeded in this exercise.

The goal:
To clearly understand who you are and what you do — and to be able to communicate it in a way that others remember.

When people understand what you do, they’ll talk about you.
And when they talk about you with friends, it can lead to help, small contracts, new opportunities, and job offers. It’s that simple.

When a job isn’t the right fit for you, use the four words others have used to describe your contacts — and refer the client to someone better suited. Everyone wins.

PS: 
- Don’t describe what you want to do. But what you are and are doing.
- Do not present a story, you will be speaking face to face to your target.
- Is you pitch is idiot proved and can’t be misunderstood ?
- Do you speak about Who, What, Why of your idea ?
- A pitch is a filter that allow your auditor and you to check your compatibility on the concept.
